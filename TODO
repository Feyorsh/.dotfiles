.githooks
	Mirror structure of .git/hooks so we can use stow in setup
setup
	See above
tmux
	Add some more plugins
	Tweak tmux.conf
nvim
	Add a good theme
	Figure out extensions for compiling/quickfix
	Change the highlight color of brackets/quotes (annoying)
starship
	Potentially do some more prompt tweaking
		|= Definitely fix the pipe prompt (quick fix)
		|= Never mind, actually fix it pls
		|= Idea: Just print err numbers, otherwise prompt gets cluttered
	Add personal branch of starship as submodule
yabai
	Finish the script for (attempting) to accomodate chonky windows (*cough* Spotify *cough*)
skhd
	Add good combos to adjust yabai (alt seems like a good meta key)
git
	Poor fella doesn't have any config ;( (but does it need any though?)
	Note: Alternate OSs won't have macOS keychain manager, so this *might* need to be encrypted if I'm lazy enough to put PID in .gitconfig
	Configure default .gitconfig (actually, I probably don't want a default) and project .gitconfig
zsh
	Potentially add zsh-vi-mode (https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)
	Potentially spruce it up some more
	Alias 'diff' to 'git-diff'
iterm
	Potentially add iterm config to .dotfiles
	(Tangential) Figure out how to provide escapes to use meta keys (yabai/skhd) in terminal
	Potentially switch to kitty LOL

GENERAL NOTES:
	Try to manually manage plugins, but maybe git_manage works fine? We'll see once plugin managers try to pull from remote and realize there's no .git (this applies to tpm and vim-plug).
