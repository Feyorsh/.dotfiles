tmux
	Add some more plugins
	Tweak tmux.conf
	Add passthrough for tmux commands to work in iTerm integration mode
	Get iTerm status bar to accept tmux symbols (might just need a reboot)
nvim
	Write custom git dir diff for lualine
	Figure out extensions for compiling/quickfix
		Trouble.nvim?
	Change the highlight color of brackets/quotes (annoying)
	Extensions to setup:
		GX extended: figure out how to interface with native vimscript, and change the handler to work with Packer (i.e. 'use' instead of 'Plug', easy regex fix)
		which-key could be great (also my own which key website idea!)
		figure out how to use telescope like a pro
		figure out DAP and potentially dap ui later, it's broken in rust-tools anyway
			sidenote: figure out an extension for gdb and/or get good at lldb
		alpha.nvim: properly config welcome screen (random banner/quotes, layout, keybinds)

starship
	Potentially do some more prompt tweaking (fml why is git so weird)
yabai
	Finish the script for (attempting) to accomodate chonky windows (*cough* Spotify *cough*)
skhd
	Add good combos to adjust yabai (alt seems like a good meta key)
git
	Poor fella doesn't have any config ;( (but does it need any though?)
	Need to change deafult difftool to nvim
	Note: Alternate OSs won't have macOS keychain manager, so this *might* need to be encrypted if I'm lazy enough to put PID in .gitconfig
	Configure default .gitconfig (actually, I probably don't want a default) and project .gitconfig
zsh
	Potentially add zsh-vi-mode (https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)
	Potentially spruce it up some more (like what's the deal with git autocompelte?)
iterm
	Move all config info into .dotfiles (images, fonts)
	Finish braille PR
	(Tangential) Figure out how to provide escapes to use meta keys (yabai/skhd) in terminal
misc
	More waifus (DB4R)
	Write extension to edit encfs filesystems
