tmux
	Add some more plugins
	Tweak tmux.conf
	Add passthrough for tmux commands to work in iTerm integration mode
	Get iTerm status bar to accept tmux symbols (might just need a reboot)
nvim
	Configure lightline (i.e. for terminal shrinkage and git status), see https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim
	Figure out extensions for compiling/quickfix
	Figure out how to use vim-fugitive
	Change the highlight color of brackets/quotes (annoying)
	coc config lives in .config proper... Should I leave it like this because it's just node_modules?
starship
	Potentially do some more prompt tweaking (fml why is git so weird)
yabai
	Finish the script for (attempting) to accomodate chonky windows (*cough* Spotify *cough*)
skhd
	Add good combos to adjust yabai (alt seems like a good meta key)
git
	Poor fella doesn't have any config ;( (but does it need any though?)
	Note: Alternate OSs won't have macOS keychain manager, so this *might* need to be encrypted if I'm lazy enough to put PID in .gitconfig
	Configure default .gitconfig (actually, I probably don't want a default) and project .gitconfig
zsh
	Potentially add zsh-vi-mode (https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)
	Potentially spruce it up some more
iterm
	Potentially add iterm config to .dotfiles
	(Tangential) Figure out how to provide escapes to use meta keys (yabai/skhd) in terminal
